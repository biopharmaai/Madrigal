       "{'extend': 'Your task is to take original descriptions of drug-drug interactions and augment them. Make sure the information you provide is correct and valid, and the extended text is two sentences long. To ensure diversity in these descriptions, respond as each of the following: medical doctors (physician), pharmacologist and toxicologist. \\n Medical doctors: Especially those specializing in fields such as pharmacology, internal medicine, and clinical pharmacology. Hence, they understand the symptoms and organ systems affected due to the drug-drug interaction. \\n Pharmacologists: Scientists who study the effects of drugs on biological systems. They understand the genetic and molecular mechanism behind these interactions. \\n Toxicologists: Scientists who typically works with chemicals and other substances to determine if they are toxic, or harmful, to humans and other living organisms or the environment. \\n Your job is to generate nine versions of the original description (given below after ‘Original description’) - three for each profession, and at the correct level of understanding and expertise. Your responses for the scientists should be diverse in terms of style, length, and language used. Each of the scientist responses must be different in terms of the level of vocabulary used, sentence structure, and word choice. None of the nine responses can be the same or have any repeating sentences. Please also make sure you do not make any assumptions about @Drug1 and @Drug2. \\n An example output is given for you after ‘Example’. The description to augment is given after ‘Task’. \\n Example: \\n Description: The risk or severity of bleeding and bruising can be increased when @Drug1 is combined with @Drug2. \\n Output: {\"medical_doctor_1\": \"When @Drug1 is combined with @Drug2, there is an elevated risk of experiencing increased bleeding and bruising, a concern particularly for patients with pre-existing bleeding disorders or those on anticoagulant therapy. These patients should be closely monitored for any signs of abnormal bleeding and adjustments to therapy may be necessary.\", \"medical_doctor_2\": \"The concurrent use of @Drug1 with @Drug2 can lead to a heightened risk or severity of bleeding and bruising, necessitating careful consideration in patients undergoing surgical procedures or those with a history of bleeding problems. Its vital to evaluate the benefits and risks of continuing this drug combination in such contexts.\", \"medical_doctor_3\": \"Combining @Drug1 with @Drug2 can significantly increase the likelihood of bleeding and bruising, an issue of particular concern for individuals with liver impairment or those consuming alcohol regularly. These patients may require dose adjustments or more frequent monitoring to mitigate the risks.\", \"pharmacologist_1\": \"The interaction between @Drug1 and @Drug2 can escalate the risk of bleeding and bruising due to their synergistic effects on inhibiting platelet aggregation or affecting coagulation pathways. Understanding the molecular basis of this interaction is crucial for predicting patient responses and managing therapy effectively.\", \"pharmacologist_2\": \"When @Drug1 and @Drug2 are co-administered, they may interfere with each others pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic profiles, leading to an increased risk or severity of bleeding and bruising. This interaction suggests a complex interplay at the cellular level, possibly involving the modulation of enzymes or receptors associated with hemostasis.\", \"pharmacologist_3\": \"The combination of @Drug1 and @Drug2 can intensify bleeding and bruising risks, likely through a mechanism involving the alteration of drug metabolism or the exacerbation of anticoagulant effects. Pharmacologists should explore the specific pathways affected to tailor safer therapeutic strategies.\", \"toxicologist_1\": \"The interaction between @Drug1 and @Drug2 may elevate the risk of bleeding and bruising by enhancing the toxic effects on the bodys hemostatic system, potentially leading to hazardous conditions such as uncontrolled bleeding. Toxicologists should assess the cumulative impact of these drugs to ensure patient safety.\", \"toxicologist_2\": \"Co-administration of @Drug1 with @Drug2 can lead to increased toxicity, manifesting as heightened bleeding and bruising, by overburdening the bodys natural mechanisms for blood clotting. This interaction underscores the importance of toxicological evaluation for identifying potential adverse effects on the hemostatic process.\", \"toxicologist_3\": \"When @Drug1 and @Drug2 are used together, their combined toxic effects can compromise the integrity of the vascular and coagulation systems, increasing the risk of bleeding and bruising. This interaction highlights the need for ongoing monitoring and possibly adjusting dosages to mitigate the toxicological risks involved.”}\\n Task: \\n Description: $DESC \\nOutput:'}"
